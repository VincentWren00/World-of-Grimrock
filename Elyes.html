        <h2><center>Welcome to Elyes</center> <br> 
 The country of Elyes has a long and frustrating battle between the nation of Wimrith and Grinson. The battle began due to the nation of Wimrith's blind motivation to take as much land as they could. While trying to conquer the land of Elyes, Andar VI's army ventured too far and into the nation of Grinson. While blinded with greed of land, they attempted to attack and conquer the land they stumbled upon.<br>
<br>
Even though the nation of Grinson is a humble and peaceful one, they were stubborn and unwilling to give up the land that homes their family, friends and traditions. King Oberon of the Grinson, summoned his army and sent them to defend the borders. After a long and frustrating battle, the two kingdoms finally had to settle a compromise for the land that keeps the two nations apart. The compromise entailed that the land was to be its own free country, used for resources and home for those of who have no nation.<br>
<br>
Today, Elyes is still a decent land. The people who live there are resource workers, merchants, far out inn-keeps, far out tavern owners, and other folk. They are somewhat visited by travelers from other nations.
