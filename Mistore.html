        <h2><center>Welcome to Mistore</center> <br> 
The island of Mistore has a long and mysterious history of isolation and discovery. It traces its origins around the time of the Split of Nalac, when the people on the west side of Grimrock noticed an island. It was added to the current map we have now and remained unseen by the rest of the world for many ages.<br>
<br>
The island was visited by a group of adventurers, who stumbled upon it after hearing many tales of this undiscovered land. They wrote some of the ruins and mysteries they found. The island was visited by many travelers and explorers and many discoveries are still being noted to this day.<br>
<br>
Today, Mistore is still a hidden and marvelous land. The races who live there are gentle and wise, are they to study the ancient ruins and write about the land of Mistore. They are rarely disturbed by outsiders from other lands, and have little concern for the affairs of the world.
