        <h2><center>Welcome to Wimrith</center> <br> 
    The humans of Wimrith have a long history of adventure and exploration. They trace their origins to the Split of Nalac, when the kingdom was hungry for gaining more land no matter the cost. So after a somewhat long conflict, the large kingdom separated. To the west across the river is the now separated half of the kingdom.<br>
    <br>
    The humans of Wimrith are ruled by a series of kings. The most famous of these was Andar IV, who led his army to try to discover and conquer many other lands.<br>
    <br>
    The reign of Andar IV marked the height of Wimrith's power and will. The human kingdom was wealthy and determined, and enjoyed a high level of civilization and culture. The land of Wimrith was blessed by wealth and order, and many humans excelled in mathematics and sciences.<br>
    <br> 
    Today, Wimrith is still a thriving and orderly nation. The humans who live there are proud and confident, living in an orderly and neat kingdom. They are constantly involved in the affairs of the world. They value their ancient heritage and ideals.
