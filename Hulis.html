        <h2><center>Welcome to Hulis</center> <br> 
    The diverse races of Hulis have a long and colorful history of cooperation and conflict. They were guided by the good will of those who led the Split of Nalac, and lived in harmony with the natural world and each other.<br>
    <br>
    After the Split of Nalac, many races migrated to the south west, where they formed their own community without rule. Without rule, they live with democracy. The races of Hulis were creative and adaptable, and often mingled with the other races. They learned and exchanged their culture and resources with the lands of humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, dragonborn, tieflings, and more.<br>
    <br>
    The races of Hulis were ruled by a council of representatives, who helped with the democracy of the community due to the large number of villagers.<br>
    <br>
    Today, Hulis is still a vibrant and dynamic land. The races who live there are friendly and welcoming, living in a well sized diverse town. They are constantly seeking new opportunities and challenges, and have much hope for the future. They appreciate their ancient traditions and values.
