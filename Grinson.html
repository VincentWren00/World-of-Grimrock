        <h2><center>Welcome to Grinson</center> <br> 
            The faun and forest folk of Grinson have a long and enchanting history of magic and mystery. They trace their origins to the creation of Grimrock. They are beloved by most countries, and live in harmony with the natural world.<br>
            <br>
            Many faun and forest folk remained in the east, where they preserved their ancient kingdom. A hidden and wondrous land that borders Amer and Elyes. The faun and forest folk of Grinson were humble and curious, and often interacted with the other races. They inspired many tales and legends across some of the other countries.<br>
            <br>
            The faun and forest folk of Grinson were ruled by a series of a king and queen. The most famous of these was king Oberon and queen Titania ,the current rulers of Grinson. Their rule has kept the most peace and stability among all the nations in Grimrock.<br>
            <br>
            Due to this great ruling of their nation, they are respected by most but not all. Sadly, there are some places who either don't know the nation of Grinson or dislike faun and other forest folk.<br>
            <br>
            Today, Grinson is still a mysterious and beautiful land. The faun and forest folk who live there are humble and joyful, living in the thick forest that hides their wondrous kingdom. They are rarely seen by strangers from other lands, and have little interest in the affairs of the world. They honor their ancient traditions and history.
