        <h2><center>Welcome to Ulmug</center> <br> 
The orcs of Ulmug have a long and complex history of culture and warfare. They trace their origins to the ancient times, when the world of Grimrock was created.<br>
<br>
After many battles across the world, many orcs settled in the west, where they founded their own country and settled as a huge community.<br>
<br>
The orcs of Ulmug were ruled by a series of rulers, who claimed the title of Goruk. The most famous of these was Zaro Goruk, who unified the orc nations under his rule and established peace and prosperity. The reign of Zaro Goruk marked the peak of Ulmug's power and glory. The orc nations were united and harmonious, and enjoyed a high level of civilization and strong culture. The lands of Ulmug were blessed by abundance and strength.<br>
<br>
Today, Ulmug is still a thriving and prosperous realm. The orcs who live there are proud and happy, living in a large tribe like community. They cherish their ancient heritage and values.
